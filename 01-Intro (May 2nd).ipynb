      "\n",
      "## Object of Study\n",
      "A differential equation relates an unknown function and one of more derivatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Ex\n",
      "$$ x: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $$\n",
      "$$ x = x(t) $$\n",
      "$$ x\\prime(t) = x(t) $$\n",
      "One solution: $ x_1(t)=e^t $\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Solution $ x_2(t)=0 $\n",
      "\n",
      "## Directions of Study\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Exact Methods**: Given an equation, find all solutions. (Very hard to do)\n",
      "* **Numerical Methods**: Use computers (today!) to obtain approximations of specific solutions.\n",
      "* **Qualitative Methods**: Obtain properties of the solutions without knowing the solution explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Classification\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Domain of the Unkown Function**\n",
      "    * Ordinary differential equation (**ODE**): Depends on a single variable.\n",
      "    * Partial differential equation (**PDE**): Depend on more then one variable.\n",
      "* **Number of Unknowns**\n",
      "    * For example:\n",
      "        $$ x = x(t), y=y(t) $$\n",
      "        $$ x\\prime = 2y $$\n",
      "        $$ y\\prime = x+3y $$\n",
      "        One solution: x(t)=y(t)=0\n",
      "* **Structure of the Equation**\n",
      "    * Linear: The unknowns are functions at power 1\n",
      "    * Nonlinear: The unknowns are functions that are not linear.\n",
      "* **Order of the Equation**\n",
      "    * Order $k$ if the highest derivative is the $k^{th}$ derivative.\n",
      "    * Ex. Second order: $ x\\prime\\prime = 2x $\n",
